# Diego-Collection
A collection of the many small projects I made during Google CSSI,and on my own in Javascript, using the p5 and p5 Collide2D libraries 

All of them are altered to allow me to fit them on one HTML file, and also updated to be more readable, lightweight, and efficient. 

In the future, after I update and implement all the projects I want, I will update the projects with more features I wasn't able to add at the time
